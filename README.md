Bumblebee provides pre-trained and transformer Neural Network models on top of [Axon](https://github.com/elixir-nx/axon). It includes integration with [ðŸ¤— Models](https://huggingface.co/models), allowing anyone to download and perform Machine Learning tasks with few lines of code.

To see all supported architectures, [check out our documentation sidebar](https://hexdocs.pm/bumblebee).

## Usage

First add Bumblebee and EXLA as dependencies. EXLA is an optional dependency but an important one as it allows you to compile models just-in time and run them on CPU/GPU:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:bumblebee, "~> 0.2.0"},
    {:exla, ">= 0.0.0"}
  ]
end
```

Then configure `Nx` to use EXLA backend by default in your `config/config.exs` file:

```elixir
import Config
config :nx, default_backend: EXLA.Backend
```

To use GPUs, you must [set the `XLA_TARGET` environment variable accordingly](https://github.com/elixir-nx/xla#usage).

In notebooks and scripts, use the following `Mix.install/2` call to both install and configure dependencies:

```elixir
Mix.install(
  [
    {:bumblebee, "~> 0.2.0"},
    {:exla, ">= 0.0.0"}
  ],
  config: [nx: [default_backend: EXLA.Backend]]
)
```

## Examples

To explore Bumblebee:

  * See [examples/phoenix](examples/phoenix) for single-file examples of running Neural Networks inside your Phoenix (+ LiveView) apps

  * Use Bumblebee's integration with Livebook v0.8 (or later) to automatically generate "Neural Networks tasks" from the "+ Smart" cell menu (thanks to [`:kino_bumblebee`](https://github.com/livebook-dev/kino_bumblebee))

  * For a more hands on approach, read our example [notebooks](notebooks)
