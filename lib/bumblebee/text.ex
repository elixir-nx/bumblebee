  Builds serving for token classification.

  The serving accepts `t:token_classification_input/0` and returns
  `t:token_classification_output/0`. A list of inputs is also supported.

  This function can be used for tasks such as named entity recognition
  (NER) or part of speech tagging (POS).

  The recognized entities can optionally be aggregated into groups
  based on the given strategy.

  ## Options

    * `:aggregation` - an optional strategy for aggregating adjacent
      tokens. Token classification models output probabilities for
      each possible token class. The aggregation strategy takes scores
      for each token (which possibly represents subwords) and groups
      tokens into phrases which are readily interpretable as entities
      of a certain class. Supported aggregation strategies:

        * `nil` (default) - corresponds to no aggregation and returns
          the most likely label for each input token

        * `:same` - groups adjacent tokens with the same label. If
          the labels use beginning-inside-outside (BIO) tagging, the
          boundaries are respected and the prefix is omitted in the
          output labels

        * `:word_first` - uses `:same` strategy except that word tokens
          cannot end up with different labels. With this strategy word
          gets the label of the first token of that word when there
          is ambiguity. Note that this works only on word based models

        * `:word_average` - uses `:same` strategy except that word tokens
          cannot end up with different labels. With this strategy scores
          are averaged across word tokens and then the maximum label
          is taken. Note that this works only on word based models

        * `:word_max` - uses `:same` strategy except that word tokens
          cannot end up with different labels. With this strategy word
          gets the label of the token with the maximum score. Note that
          this works only on word based models

    * `:ignored_labels` - the labels to ignore in the final output.
      The labels should be specified without BIO prefix. Defaults to
      `["O"]`

    * `:compile` - compiles all computations for predefined input shapes
      during serving initialization. Should be a keyword list with the
      following keys:

        * `:batch_size` - the maximum batch size of the input. Inputs
          are optionally padded to always match this batch size

        * `:sequence_length` - the maximum input sequence length. Input
          sequences are always padded/truncated to match that length

      It is advised to set this option in production and also configure
      a defn compiler using `:defn_options` to maximally reduce inference
      time.

    * `:scores_function` - the function to use for converting logits to
      scores. Should be one of `:softmax`, `:sigmoid`, or `:none`.
      Defaults to `:softmax`

    * `:defn_options` - the options for JIT compilation. Defaults to `[]`
